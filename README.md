An 'about me' website.
It contains architecture, and photography portfolio, few words about me, contact form, and hidden developer panel. The panel helps me to control projects. It edits them, removes, and adds new ones.

Tech stack and features:
React Router | API (all data are stored on Firebase) | Context | Sass | CSS modules | form validation |.
